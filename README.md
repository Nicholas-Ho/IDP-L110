# Integrated Design Project - Group L110
Repository for IDP code for an Arduino-controlled robot that follows a line and seeks out and sorts coloured blocks.

## How to use this repository
Each team has a folder to themselves (`mechanical`, `electronics`, `software`). Materials (documents, CAD files, PCB models) should be updated in the respective folders regularly. Don't worry about preserving older versions of tings, once it's committed we can always go back and recover/view it.

Each team also has a branch to themselves (`mechanical`, `electronics`. Software might have more than one branch). **Always work in the respective branch** (if you're uploading a CAD file, make sure you're in the `mechanical` branch).

### Workflow
Here's how to use the repository:
1. **NEVER WORK IN THE MAIN BRANCH.** Always make sure you're in the respective branch (`mechanical` if you're working on mechanical etc)
2. Work in the respective folder.
3. When you're done updating things, commit and push the branch to the GitHub.
4. Regularly do pull requests (ask Nicholas) to ensure that the main branch is up to date.
