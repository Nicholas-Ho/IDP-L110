### Integrated Design Project - Group L110
Repository for IDP code for an Arduino-controlled robot that follows a line and seeks out and sorts coloured blocks.

## Objective
The ultimate objective is to find coloured blocks, determine their colour and deliver to the correct area based on their colour. The block can be delivered to the floor of the delivery area or onto the truck for extra points. The area contains white lines for guidance. An obstacle is situated between the starting and the drop off areas and the collection area which can be avoided by using either a ramp or tunnel. Each time a block is transported back across the obstacle a new block will be placed on one of the collection markers.

## To-Do
In terms of software, the following areas need to be worked on:
- Control system (line following algorithm, junction handling and motor control)
- Computer vision (block and junction positioning, and path planning)
